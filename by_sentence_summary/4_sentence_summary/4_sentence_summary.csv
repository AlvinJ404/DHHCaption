"So what we want to do is we want to go from images like this one, so not just relating on the face and looking also at the context of the person, trying to recognize emotions, and for that, so this is a computer vision project. We know that in computer vision nowadays what is working best is deep learning models. So our idea was, okay, let's try to model this problem using deep learning. So first challenge that we faced, we didn't have any training data, of course, because as we said before, usually all the research on emotion recognition from images was focused on the face, so we didn't have any data set where we could see people in their context.","We want to use images to recognize emotions from faces and context.
