So I was working a little bit in this type of software, trying to recognize key points in the faces, working with images acquired under controlled environments, and nothing was working by then. So now after 10 years, we have these softwares that work very well in recognizing some of the key points on your face, tracking these key points, and doing some matching between the emotions, so the expressions that are observed and the possible emotions that they are expressing. This is an example of a commercial software from a company called Affectiva, where you see that the software detects your key points, analyzes the configuration, and makes some kind of correspondence between this expression and the possible emotion that you are expressing with the facial expression","Facial expressions help recognize emotions.

So it can capture the contribution of the different words to this prediction. And actually, this demo is very cool, because you can cross the different words and see how the emojis change when you remove some words. So this is working pretty well. And there are other models that are similar to this one that also work pretty well for tech sentiment analysis.",The deep learning model's attention layer shows word intensity variations in predictions.
