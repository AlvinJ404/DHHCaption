Original sentence: So facial expression is actually the most common approach to recognize emotions. So when I was doing my PhD, I finished like 10 years ago now. And this was a completely unsolved problem. So I was working a little bit in this type of software, trying to recognize key points in the faces, working with images acquired under controlled environments, and nothing was working by then. So now after 10 years, we have these softwares that work very well in recognizing some of the key points on your face, tracking these key points, and doing some matching between the emotions, so the expressions that are observed and the possible emotions that they are expressing. This is an example of a commercial software from a company called Affectiva, where you see that the software detects your key points, analyzes the configuration, and makes some kind of correspondence between this expression and the possible emotion that you are expressing with the facial expression. Summary: Facial expressions are key to recognizing emotions. Years ago, during my PhD, this was unsolved. I worked on software for recognizing facial points under controlled conditions, but it failed.
